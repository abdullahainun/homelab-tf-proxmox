## Overview

This project uses Terraform to automate the deployment and management of various components in my home lab. It includes infrastructure such as virtual machines, networks, and other services necessary to simulate real-world IT environments for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Access to your preferred cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure
- Basic understanding of Terraform and its concepts

## Getting Started

   cd homelab-tf-general
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

## Configuration

Before applying the configurations, you may need to adjust certain variables to suit your environment. You can find and modify these variables in the `variables.tf` file.
